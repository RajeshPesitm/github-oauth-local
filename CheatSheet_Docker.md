Absolutely! Here's a clean, beginner-friendly `README.md` that summarizes Docker basics — including commands for starting/stopping containers, when to rebuild, the image vs container distinction, and lifecycle overview.

# 🚀 Docker Basics for Developers

This guide covers the essentials you need to understand and work with Docker efficiently during development.

---

## 🔧 Start and Stop Docker Containers

### ▶️ Start Containers
```bash
docker-compose up -d
````

* `-d` means detached (runs in background).
* Use this after the initial build unless code changes require a rebuild.

### ⏹️ Stop and Remove Containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

* Stops and **removes** containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose`.

### ⏸️ Temporarily Stop (Pause) Containers

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

* Stops containers without removing them (can be restarted).

---

## 🛠️ Rebuilding Containers

You **do not** need to rebuild every time you change your code if:

* Your code is mounted as a volume (e.g., `./app:/app`).
* You use hot-reloading tools like Vite or FastAPI with `--reload`.

### 🔁 Rebuild When:

* You change `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, or `.env`.

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## 📄 View Docker Containers and Images

### 🔍 View Running Containers

```bash

```

### 🧾 View All Containers (including stopped)

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### 🧱 View Docker Images

```bash
docker images
```

## 🧠 Docker: Image vs Container

| Term          | Description                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Image**     | Blueprint (like a class in code) |
| **Container** | Running instance of an image     |

---

## 🔄 Docker Lifecycle Summary

```text
Build   → docker-compose build
Create  → docker-compose up
Start   → docker start <container>
Run     → Container is running
Stop    → docker stop <container>
Restart → docker restart <container>
Remove  → docker rm <container>
```

## 🧰 Common Docker Commands

| Command                       | Purpose                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `docker ps`                   | See running containers         |
| `docker ps -a`                | See all containers             |
| `docker images`               | List images                    |
| `docker-compose up -d`        | Start containers in background |
| `docker-compose down`         | Stop and remove containers     |
| `docker-compose build`        | Rebuild services               |
| `docker logs <name>`          | View container logs            |
| `docker exec -it <name> bash` | Enter container shell          |
| `docker stop <name>`          | Stop container                 |
| `docker rm <name>`            | Remove container               |
| `docker rmi <image>`          | Remove image                   |

## ✅ Tips

* Use `docker-compose logs -f` to watch logs live.
* Use `.env` files to manage environment variables cleanly.
* Volume mounts let you develop live without rebuilding containers.
